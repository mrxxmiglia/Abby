            "It’s crucial for optimal weight loss that you have a 60-minute walk every day, at any time between 6am and 7pm. Ideally, outdoors, if weather allows. It’s also crucial to never become short of breath during this walk. If you can keep a normal conversation while you walk, you are walking at the right pace. Also, you should NOT perform any physical activity at which you become short of breath, as such activity will make you gain weight. The only exception to this rule is doing HIIT for three minutes, three times per week. Lastly, I highly recommend you lift weights three times per week. Once again, without becoming short of breath.
